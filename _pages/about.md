My name is Aatif, and I am a passionate computer scientist specializing in the field of computer vision. 

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Delhi University, where I developed a solid foundation in various computer science disciplines. Building on this knowledge, I pursued my Master's degree in Computer Science from South Asian University, focusing on advanced topics in Machine Learning.

### Research Experience

I am a Project Scientist at the esteemed Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, collaborating closely with [Prof. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/) and [Prof. Nandana Sengupta](https://spp.iitd.ac.in/faculty-profile/5). Currently, I am involved in the following projects:

- Working on the project “Enhancing India’s Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy Analysis Capabilities” at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.
- Investigating possibilities of automated estimation of household-level economic variables – income and assets, typically measured using a detailed household survey.
- Utilizing Transfer Learning techniques, specifically using Vision Transformers, and Metric Learning techniques to analyze images from four North-east states of India for the purpose of predicting household income.



### Research Interests

Driven by a deep curiosity and a desire to make a meaningful impact, I am now seeking a Ph.D. opportunity in the field of computer vision. My goal is to push the boundaries of this exciting domain, contributing to advancements in areas such as Social Impact using Computer Vision, Generative AI, and Multimodality (Vision and NLP).

### Technical Skills

Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a strong research mindset, which has honed my ability to tackle complex problems, analyze data, and present my findings effectively. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, C++, and MATLAB, and I am experienced in utilizing popular computer vision libraries and frameworks like OpenCV, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

### Collaboration and Communication

Aside from my technical expertise, I possess excellent communication and teamwork skills, which have been nurtured through my collaborative research projects and participation in academic conferences. I believe that effective collaboration and knowledge-sharing are integral to achieving breakthroughs in computer vision research.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. I invite you to explore my resume, publications, and achievements, and I look forward to connecting with fellow researchers, professors, and industry professionals who share a passion for advancing computer vision technology.
