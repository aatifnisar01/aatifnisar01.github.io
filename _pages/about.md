My name is Aatif, and I am a passionate computer scientist specializing in the field of computer vision.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Delhi University](https://www.du.ac.in/), where I developed a solid foundation in various computer science disciplines. Building on this knowledge, I pursued my Master's degree in Computer Science from [South Asian University](https://sau.int/), focusing on advanced topics in Machine Learning.

### Research Experience

I am a Project Scientist at the esteemed [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), collaborating closely with [Prof. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/) and [Prof. Nandana Sengupta](https://spp.iitd.ac.in/faculty-profile/5). Currently, I am involved in the following work:

- Working on the project “Enhancing India’s Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy Analysis Capabilities” in the Vision Lab at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.
- Investigating possibilities of automated estimation of household-level economic variables – income and assets, typically measured using a detailed household survey.
- Utilizing Transfer Learning techniques, specifically using Vision Transformers, and Metric Learning techniques to analyze images from four North-east states of India for the purpose of predicting household income.



### Research Interests

Driven by a deep curiosity and a desire to make a meaningful impact, I am now seeking a Ph.D. opportunity in the field of computer vision. I am interested in the questions of FATE (fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics) in computer vision systems. 

### Technical Skills

Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a strong research mindset, which has honed my ability to tackle complex problems, analyze data, and present my findings effectively. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, C++, and MATLAB, and I am experienced in utilizing popular computer vision libraries and frameworks like OpenCV, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

### Collaboration and Communication

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. I invite you to explore my resume, publications, and other writings, and I look forward to connecting with fellow researchers, professors, and industry professionals who share a passion for advancing computer vision technology.
