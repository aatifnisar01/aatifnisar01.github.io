I am a first year PhD student at `Virginia Tech`, working with Prof. [Shaddi Hasan](https://www.shaddih.com/). My research interests are in `Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD)`, `AI/ML`, and `Remote Sensing`. 

I am building <span class="playcard" tabindex="0" aria-describedby="playcard-appropriate">appropriate<span id="playcard-appropriate" class="playcard-tooltip" role="tooltip">Appropriate means that technologies should be designed keeping the social context in mind — what material is available locally, how tools can be repaired, who will use them, and how.</span></span> technologies to address socioeconomic inequalities and the digital divide. These research interests are shaped by my past research experiences. I worked as a project scientist with Prof. [Aaditeshwar Seth](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/) in the ICTD lab of IIT Delhi where I have worked on 1. Predicting ponds, wells, and plantation trees using high-resolution Google Maps imagery 2. Assessing equity in access to water, and 3. Socioeconomic prediction using satellite data.

Before that I was a project scientist in the [Vision Lab](https://vision-iitd.github.io/people/) of IIT Delhi with Prof. [Nandana Sengupta](https://sites.google.com/site/nandanasenguptahome/home) and Prof. [Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~chetan/) working on *Assessing the Feasibility and Ethics of Economic Status Prediction using Deep Learning on Household Images*. I also worked as a research assistant at Ashoka University with Prof. [Anirban Sen](https://sites.google.com/ashoka.edu.in/anirbansen/home?authuser=0) on *PolicyStory: Leveraging Large Language Models to Generate Comprehensible Summaries of Policy-News in India*. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Delhi University and my master’s degree in Computer Science from South Asian University. During my master’s, I worked with Prof. [Reshma Rastogi](https://sau.int/faculty/reshma-rastogi/) on *MLGAN: Addressing Imbalance in Multilabel Learning Using Generative Adversarial Networks*.
