## About Me

I am a Research Associate at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), working with [Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/) in the [ICTD lab](http://act4d.iitd.ac.in/). My research focuses on leveraging AI for social good and human-centered computing.

### Current Projects

1. **Tracking Socio-economic Development in Rural India Using Satellite Imagery**
2. **Identification of Water Bodies, Plantations, and Crop Fields from Google Maps**

Before joining IIT Delhi, I worked as a Project Scientist in the [Vision Lab](https://vision-iitd.github.io/) at IIT Delhi, where I explored automated estimation of household-level economic variables.

### Research Interests

My interests lie in:
- Promoting social well-being in low-resource environments
- Leveraging AI for innovations in Sustainability, Public Health, and Conservation
- Addressing bias and harm in AI applications to foster inclusivity
- Enhancing privacy considerations in AI applications

### Education

- **Master's in Computer Science**: South Asian University (SAU)
- **Bachelor's in Computer Science**: Delhi University

During my master's, I focused on advanced topics in Machine Learning, particularly addressing data imbalance in Multi-Label datasets using Generative Adversarial Networks.

### Interests

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and exploring new cuisines. I'm always eager to connect with fellow researchers, professors, and industry professionals to discuss AI and its societal impact.
