My name is Aatif, and I am a Research Associate at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), working with [Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/). Currently I am working on 1) Tracking Socio-economic Development in Rural India Using Satellite Imagery 2) Identification of water bodies and plantations from Google maps.

Before this, I was a Project Scientist at IIT Delhi, working with [Prof. Nandana Sengupta](https://spp.iitd.ac.in/faculty-profile/5) and [Prof. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/). I worked on investigating possibilities of automated estimation of household-level economic variables â€“ income and assets, typically measured using a detailed household survey. 

### Research Interests

I am broadly interested in Human-centered computing, Responsible AI, and AI for social good. I often think about how there aren't enough people from different backgrounds in academia, leading me to reflect on how homogenized groups can influence ideas and research. My research goal is to make a meaningful impact using AI. 
I am particularly interested in Trustworthy AI (i.e., on the issues related to fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics). 

### Education 

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Delhi University](https://www.du.ac.in/), where I developed a solid foundation in various computer science disciplines. Building on this knowledge, I pursued my Master's degree in Computer Science from [South Asian University (SAU)](https://sau.int/), focusing on advanced topics in Machine Learning. At SAU, I worked with [Prof. Reshma Rastogi](https://sau.int/faculty/reshma-rastogi/) for my thesis, which focussed on addressing the persistent challenge of data imbalance
in Multi-Label datasets using Generative Adversarial Networks.

When I am not working; I cook, I travel, and I eat. I look forward to connecting with fellow researchers, professors, and industry professionals and I am always open to having a discussion on AI. If you are interested, feel free to reach out via email or Twitter!
