    <strong>(Master's Dissertation) Generative Adversarial Networks and its Applications, South Asian University.</strong>
    <em>May '21 - May '22</em>
    <br>
    (Prof. Reshma Rastogi)
    <ul>
      <li>Executed GAN on MNIST Digit dataset and MNIST Fashion dataset with Self Attention Module and Spectral Normalization in both Generator and Discriminator. Added TTUR (Two Time Scale Update) to stabilize the training of the GAN.</li>
      <li>Implemented CycleGAN, Pix2PixGAN, StyleGAN, SMIT, and AttentionGAN on the CelebA dataset.</li>
      <li>Outcome of my dissertation was a novel architecture called MLGAN (Multi-Label Generative Adversarial Network), which was designed to address the challenge of data imbalance in multilabel datasets.</li>
