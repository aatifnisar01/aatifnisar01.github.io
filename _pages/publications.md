## Projects

### Research Projects

**Tracking Socio-Economic Development in Rural India over Two Decades Using Satellite Imagery**
*(Jan 2024 - Present)*

- Examining the evolution of rural India's socio-economic landscape across a span of two decades through the analysis of satellite imagery and nightlight data.
- This work provides evidence of the possible impact that policy changes and other factors have on the development of regions.

### Master's Dissertation

**Generative Adversarial Networks and its Applications, South Asian University.**
*(May 2021 - May 2022)*

- Executed GAN on MNIST Digit dataset and MNIST Fashion dataset with Self Attention Module and Spectral Normalization in both Generator and Discriminator. Added TTUR (Two Time Scale Update) to stabilize the training of the GAN.
- Implemented CycleGAN, Pix2PixGAN, StyleGAN, SMIT, and AttentionGAN on the CelebA dataset.
- Outcome of my dissertation was a novel architecture called MLGAN (Multi-Label Generative Adversarial Network), which was designed to address the challenge of data imbalance in multilabel datasets.
