## Projects

- **(Master's Dissertation) Generative Adversarial Networks and its Applications, South Asian University.**
  - *May 2021 - May 2022*
  - [Prof. Reshma Rastogi](https://sau.int/faculty/reshma-rastogi/)
  - Executed GAN on MNIST Digit dataset and MNIST Fashion dataset with Self Attention Module and Spectral Normalization in both Generator and Discriminator. Added TTUR (Two Time Scale Update) to stabilize the training of the GAN.
  - Implemented CycleGAN, Pix2PixGAN, StyleGAN, SMIT, and AttentionGAN on the CelebA dataset.
  - Outcome of my dissertation was a novel architecture called MLGAN (Multi-Label Generative Adversarial Network), which was designed to address the challenge of data imbalance in multilabel datasets.

  - Dissertation: [Link to the dissertation](http://aatifnisar01.github.io/files/MSc_Thesis.pdf)

- **PHP**
  - Designed a website ‘Learn PHP’ for my semester project using HTML, CSS, and PHP with Apache as the webserver.
  - *2019*
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aatifnisar01/Learn-PHP-Website)

- **Software Engineering Project**
  - Developed an online web-based tuition platform where students get help in finding suitable teachers to study a particular subject.
  - *2019*
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aatifnisar01/ONLINE-TUTOR-FINDING-SYSTEM-SOFTWARE-ENGINEERING-PROJECT)

- **Android Studio**
  - Created an online attendance apk using Android Studio where the teacher enters student details at once and marks students either present or absent.
  - *2018*
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aatifnisar01/Attendence-System---Andriod)
